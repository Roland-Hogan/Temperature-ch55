// 1. Declare Variables
// Using let

let character = "Jade";
let action = "running";
let place = "on the beach";
let time = "at sunrise"
let object = "pole";

// using "const"
const occasion = "wedding";

// 2. create the story
console.log("--- Funy Story ---");
console.log(character + " was " + place + time );
console.log(" As " + character +  " was " + action + " " + place + " she ran into a " + object);
console.log("The " + object + " was sticking up out of the sand.");
console.log("The " + object + " was part of a decoration for a " + occasion);
console.log("When " + character + " ran into the " + object + " she made a loud crash that disturbed the " + occasion);


// 3. Experiment with Different Values
console.log("---Different Cersion of the Story---");

// Change values to create a different story
character = "Mark";
action = "dropped his cake";
place = "reception";
time = "noon";
object = "chair";

console.log("At the " + occasion + " " + character + " was enjoying his cake");
console.log("Around " + time + " " + character + " " + action);
console.log(character + " " + action + " after he bumped into a " + object);
